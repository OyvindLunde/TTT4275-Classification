# TTT4275 Classification Project
## Stian Mjelde Jakobsen and Ã˜yvind Reppen Lunde

**The following repository contains our Classification project in the NTNU course TTT4275. The project is divided in two parts: Classifying different variants of the Iris flower using a linear classifier, and classifying handwritten numbers using a nearest neighbours classifier.**


## The Iris task
The entire Iris task is programmed in Python. The code is only tested on Mac, and while it should work on other operating systems, you might encounter some file path problems on e.g. Windows.





## The Handwritten numbers task
The entire Handwritten numbers task is programmed in Matlab. 

### Running the code
To run the code you will need to load the 'data_all.mat' file, which can be found in the /handwritten_numbers_task/number_data/MNist_ttt4275/ folder. 

To run the task2c.m files, you need to run 'clustering.m' first.
