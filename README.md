# TTT4275 Classification Project
## Stian Mjelde Jakobsen and Ã˜yvind Reppen Lunde

**The following repository contains our Classification project in the NTNU course TTT4275. The project is divided in two parts: Classifying different variants of the Iris flower using a linear classifier, and classifying handwritten numbers using a nearest neighbours classifier.**


## The Iris task
The entire Iris task is programmed in Python. The master branch is tested on Mac, while the 'windows' branch is tested on Windows, using VS Code. Run the program by running the 'Iris.py' file.


## The Handwritten numbers task
The entire Handwritten numbers task is programmed in Matlab. To run the code you will need to load the 'data_all.mat' file, which can be found in the /handwritten_numbers_task/number_data/MNist_ttt4275/ folder. 

To run the task2c.m files, you need to run 'clustering.m' first.
